    <h1>Brief description on Ghost of Tsushima</h1>
    <p>Sucker Punch Productions created the action-adventure game Ghost of Tsushima, which Sony Interactive Entertainment released. The player takes control of Jin Sakai, a samurai on a mission to defend Tsushima Island, in this game, which is set in 1274 during the first Mongol invasion of Japan. There is a sizable open area in the game that may be explored on foot or on horseback. When confronted by foes, the player has two options: use Jin's katana to fight them head-on or transform into "The Ghost," a famous fighter who kills opponents covertly.</p>
